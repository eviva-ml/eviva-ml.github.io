<h1> IEEE VIS 2019 Workshop on Evaluation of Interactive Visual Machine Learning Systems (EVIVA-ML)</h1>
<p>October 20 or 21, 2019 in Vancouver, BC, Canada </p>

<h2>Goal</h2>
Recent advances in machine learning saw the rise of powerful automatic methods to build robust predictive models from data. To enhance understanding and improve performance, human-centered approaches have been pursued. In interactive visual machine learning (IVML) systems such as [1,2,3,4,5], a human operator and a machine collaborate to achieve a task, mediated by an interactive visual interface. Typically, an IVML system comprizes an automated service, a user interface, and a learning component. In IVML, the role of the human operator may not be only to interpret and understand the underlying models or decisions, but to also actively act on, and react to, these models. This brings forth first the known problems of intelligibility, trust and usability issues, but also many open questions with respect to the evaluation of the various facets of the IVML system, both as separate components, and as a holistic entity that includes both human and machine intelligence. Identifying the best evaluation methods to follow for validating machine learning (ML) and interactive visual machine learning (IVML) models remain a challenging topic.

The  goal  of  the EVIVA-ML  workshop  is  to  bring  together  visualization  researchers and practitioners to discuss experiences and viewpoints on how to effectively evaluate interactive visual machine learning systems (IVML). Ultimately, the workshop aims to form a plan to develop a research agenda for IVML evaluation.
